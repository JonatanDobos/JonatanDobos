## Welcome to Jonatan Dobos' GitHub!

### What you will find:
- Codam Coding College (Amsterdam, part of 42-network) coding projects. (All these repositories have '_42' at the end)
- Personal projects and experimenting.

Programming is one of the most usefull skills one can have these days. That is also the part where my interest for coding resides.  
It is a beatiful thing to be able to create fully custom tools for every unique challenge we face.
